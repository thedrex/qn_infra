hey, quicknode! my solution is up at http://192.241.213.87.

we've got three parts:
webserver/
  eight lines of python that use flask to serve up the /test endpoint with our result
  
ansible/
  a tidy playbook that automates deployment to new servers - anything ubuntu you have ssh root access to
  
systemd/
  a small service definition we install so systemd will watchdog for us after crashes and restarts

the playbook verifies packages, checks out code, installs our service, and kicks things off.
to see it in action, run: ansible-playbook ansible/playbook.yml -i 192.241.213.87, -u root 
change the IP to a fresh infra test machine to get the whole experience :)

rationale:
i like that everything here is super lightweight and portable -- it'll work on most any ubuntu version.

finally, speaking of portable, there's a dockerfile. it's not being used anywhere -- just a quick example
of the kind of solution I would have likely gone with if you hadn't provided me an instance. thanks, this was fun!
